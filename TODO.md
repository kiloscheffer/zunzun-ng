# TODO — known deferred issues

Tracked items that are real defects or loose ends, but are scoped out of the
current branch. Each entry documents the symptom, the hypothesis, what we
*didn't* do, and where to pick up from.

## 3D fit spawn-Pool deadlock on Windows smoke

**Symptom.** When `scripts/smoke_test.py` runs a 3D polynomial-quadratic fit
against a 12-point (X, Y, Z) grid (`/FitEquation__F__/3/Polynomial/Full Quadratic/`),
the smoke harness never sees the final result body. The main waitress-server
python.exe silently stops writing output ~15 matplotlib reports into the fit's
report generation and stays idle for 80+ minutes with 3 zombie spawn-Pool
workers at ~5 MB resident each. Manual click-through on the live server works
fine — the deadlock is only reproducible under smoke.

**When we hit it.** 2026-04-18, Phase 1 of the Django 2.2 → 5.2 LTS migration
(plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-18-django-upgrade.md`, Task 4).

**Hypothesis.** A spawn-Pool worker dies silently during matplotlib report
rendering (OOM? import race? ImageMagick `magick mogrify` shellout hang?).
The parent's `pool.map_async(...).get()` blocks forever because spawn on
Windows has no equivalent of SIGCHLD — a dead child is indistinguishable from
a slow child. 2D fits generate ~4 reports per run; 3D generates ~15. Exposure
probability scales with report count, which is why 2D smoke has been stable
across dozens of runs and 3D tripped immediately.

**What we did instead.** Dropped the `polynomial_quadratic_3D` scenario from
the smoke test. The final smoke suite has 8 scenarios (was planned to be 9).
This preserves the migration's test-expansion intent for every other path but
leaves 3D coverage as a known hole.

**Where to pick up.**
- Reproduce: uncomment the `_DATA_3D_POLY` / `_POLY_QUAD_3D_FIELDS` / scenario
  block from the plan's Task 4 and run `uv run python scripts/smoke_test.py`.
  Budget ≥30 min; deadlock currently happens around the 15th `.png` written
  to `temp/`.
- Diagnose options (pick one):
  1. Instrument `CreateOutputReportsInParallelUsingProcessPool` in
     `StatusMonitoredLongRunningProcessPage.py` to log per-worker lifecycle
     events (enter / exit / exception); rerun the 3D smoke and see which
     worker doesn't emit an exit event.
  2. Replace `multiprocessing.Pool` with `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`
     which surfaces child exceptions on `.result()` rather than swallowing them.
  3. Add a per-worker wall-clock timeout wrapper; if a worker exceeds N seconds,
     force-kill and fail the fit rather than hanging.
- Fix (TBD — depends on diagnosis). Likely a small pyeq3/matplotlib interaction
  patch or a pool-wrapper change in the LRP base class. Unrelated to anything
  else in the Django migration.

**Not in scope of the Django 5.2 branch.** Fixing this deserves its own
branch and its own spec/plan cycle, since the root cause is in the
spawn-Pool pattern (shared with the cross-platform migration), not in
Django version compatibility.

## Spline + UDF session round-trip not smoke-covered

**Symptom / exposure.** Phase 3 of the Django 5.2 migration introduced
`_json_native` at all `SaveSpecificDataToSessionStore` sites in the LRP
subclass tree, which converts numpy arrays to plain Python lists before
the session write. Two specific shapes land in session data but aren't
exercised end-to-end by smoke:

1. **`FitSpline.scipySpline` is a tuple `(knots_ndarray, coefs_ndarray, degree_int)`.**
   After `_json_native`, this becomes `[list_of_floats, list_of_floats, int]`.
   `EvaluateAtAPointView` reads it back via `LoadItemFromSessionStore` and
   assigns to `equation.scipySpline`. scipy's `BSpline` / `splev` functions
   accept tuple-of-arrays but may raise on list-of-lists. There is no smoke
   scenario for spline fits — `scripts/smoke_test.py` does not POST to any
   `/FitEquation__F__/[23]/Spline/...` URL.

2. **`FitUserDefinedFunction.solvedCoefficients`** stores a numpy array
   which is now cast to a list at write time. `EvaluateAtAPointView`
   converts back via `numpy.array(...)` when loading, so this one is
   likely fine — but no smoke scenario exercises UDF end-to-end, so the
   claim is unverified.

**When we hit it.** 2026-04-18, Phase 3 refactor. `_json_native` was
applied defensively across all Fit* subclasses because numpy → JSON
would crash at runtime otherwise. Smoke coverage for these paths was
out of scope for the Django 5.2 branch.

**Hypothesis.** The spline case is the real risk. scipy's BSpline
constructors are historically strict about array-vs-list types. A user
who completes a spline fit and then clicks Evaluate-at-a-Point may get
a TypeError.

**Where to pick up.**
- Add a `spline_2D` smoke scenario: POST to `/FitEquation__F__/2/Spline/...`
  with a suitable equation + dataset, chain Evaluate-at-a-Point after it
  the same way `evaluate_at_a_point` chains after `polynomial_quadratic_2D`.
- Add a `udf_2D` smoke scenario: POST to `/FitUserDefinedFunction__F__/2/`
  with a simple formula like `a + b*X`, chain evaluation.
- If either fails with a scipy type error, the fix is at the load site
  (`EvaluateAtAPointView`): after `LoadItemFromSessionStore(...)`, cast
  back to the right scipy-accepted shape before assigning.

**Not in scope of the Django 5.2 branch.** The 5.2 branch delivered its
intended surface; these two scenarios are low-frequency user paths and
exercising them is future work.
